# Pi2Go

Java API to control a PI2GO-Lite (http://pi2go.co.uk/).
The library support all the features of the robot, wheels sensors and cam servos too.

All the component use the PI4J library (http://pi4j.com/) except for the HCSR04 ultrasound sensor that use a native library build base on the Wiring Pi library ( http://wiringpi.com/ )

The servos, for pan and tilt camera, are supported via the Pi4J library and the ServoBlaster driver (https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster ).

## Build the project
Before building the subproject locally you have to build the parent one. Refer to the PiRobotPlatform readme file for instructions.
Then you can build and run the program with

 mvn install 

and 

    mvn antrun:run


Runnable examples in the examplesPi2Go package:
* CommandLineMotorDriverExample.java
* IRSensorsExample.java
* LedsExample.java
* MotorsExample.java
* ServosExample.java
* SwitchExample.java
* UltrasoundSensorExample.java

You can run each one in the artifacts directory using the command sudo java -cp file.jar class for example:

    sudo java -cp Pi2Go-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar examplesPi2Go.LedsExample

**** Running the examples will make your robot move with all the possible consequences. ****
