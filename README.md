# PiRobotPlatform
Java API to control a PI2GO Lite robot and maybe, in the future, other simple robot.

This library is built around the Pi2Go-Lite robot platform ( http://www.pi2go.co.uk/ ) but with an open eye to keep it portable to many others. It full support all the Pi2Go-Lite features like the HCSR04 ultrasound sensor through  the Wiring Pi library ( http://wiringpi.com/ ), servos, for pan and tilt camera, via the ServoBlaster driver (https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster ) and motors, leds, IR sensorsâ€¦ via the Pi4J library (http://pi4j.com/).
