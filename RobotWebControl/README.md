# RobotWebControl

Example of how to use the PiRobotPlatform library to command a Pi2Go-Lite or a CamJam EduKit #3 robot using a web page on a pc, tablet, smartphone.
A web application is started using Spark micro framework (http://sparkjava.com/) so that is possible to command and receive the sensor information through a web page.
The client server communication is base on a websocket.

## Build the project
Before building the subproject locally you have to build the parent one. Refer to the PiRobotPlatform readme file for instructions.
Then you can build the program with mvn install.

Before building and running the program adjust the pom properties:

    <pi.main.class>net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.Pi2GoLiteDriver</pi.main.class>

according to your robot. The committed one is: Pi2GoLiteDriver.

Use mvn clean package assembly:single to create a zip file with all the dependencies to run the program on the Raspberry Pi and mvn antrun:run to run it.

Runnable class in the package:
* net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.CamJamEK3Driver
* net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.Pi2GoLiteDriver
* net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.RobotDriver (No robot just web interface)

You can run the program in the artifacts directory using the command:

`sudo java  -jar /home/pi/artifacts/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

to drive the robot set in the pom, or

`sudo java  -cp /home/pi/artifacts/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.Pi2GoLiteDriver`

to drive a Pi2Go-Lite or

`sudo java  -cp /home/pi/artifacts/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/RobotWebControl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar net.fustinoni.pi.robotWebControl.CamJamEK3Driver`


to drive a CamJam EduKit #3 robot.


**** Running the program will make your robot move with all the possible consequences. ****

## Program use

To run the program insert in a browser the your Raspberry Pi address followed by :4567 for example:

    http://raspi-pi2go.homenet.telecomitalia.it:4567/

A web page will start.
